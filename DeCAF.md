a rule that you cannot or will not follow.

## Copyright

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this
software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's
copyright in it.

## Ethics

This software must be used for Good, not Evil, as
determined by the primary contributors to the software.

## Excuse

license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30
days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license
ends immediately.

## Patent

they can license or become able to license.

## Reliability

This license can be removed only if all of the contributors agree to do so.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is,
without any warranty or condition, and no contributor

software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***

## Inheritance

Incorporate this license along goods or services that you develop, test, produce, or provide with the help of this software.

# Credit Requirement

## Requirement

These terms add to the terms of the license for this software. These terms become additional obligations under any agreement on those terms, as well as conditions to the license.

## Credit

Give this software and each contributor credit for contributing to goods or services that you develop, test, produce, or provide with the help of this software.

## How to Credit

In general, give credit in such a way that others can freely and readily find a written notice identifying this software, by name, as a contribution to your goods or services, as well as each contributor, by name, as a contributor to this software. Do not do anything to stop others from sharing, publishing, or using those credits.

## Conventions

If widespread convention dictates a particular way to give credit for your kind of goods or services, such as by end credit for a film, citation for an academic paper, acknowledgment for a book, or billing for a show, then follow that convention. For software provided to users to run on their own computers, give credit in documentation, notice files, and any "about" page or screen. For software provided as a web service, give credit in credits.txt according to [credits.txt](#credits.txt)

## credits.txt

For each contributor, list their name and a description of what they contributed.
Serve credits.txt as a UTF-8-encoded, plain-text file at root named credits.txt, without authentication.
Include a link in your <head> tags:
    ```<link rel="credits" href="/credits.txt" />```
See [this siteâ€™s credits.txt](https://creditstxt.com/credits.txt) for an example.

## Who to Credit

If contributors give their names or the name of this software along with the software according to a widespread convention, such as in software package metadata or on an "about" page or screen, you may rely on the names they give that way to be accurate and complete. If contributors don't give names that way, but include a link to a homepage for this software, investigate that homepage for names to credit. If contributors give neither names to credit nor a link to a homepage, you do not have to do independent research to find names to credit.
