## What is DeCAF?
DeCAF is a license ensuring to value the contributors, while promoting the reuse of code.
## How do I use it?
If widespread convention dictates a particular way to give credit for your kind of goods or services, such as by end credit for a film, citation for an academic paper, acknowledgment for a book, or billing for a show, then follow that convention. For software provided to users to run on their own computers, distribute the license in documentation, notice files, and any "about" page or screen. For more info see ```Credit Requirement```
